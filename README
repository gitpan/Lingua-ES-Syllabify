================================

This module is used to get the syllables of a Spanish word. It uses TeX::Hyphen
for initial segmentatation. You need to edit the file to specify the hyphenation
definitions file, although it may work directly as the default path is quite
standard.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

For TeX::Hyphen to properly work you need a file describing the hyphenatio
rules. See your distribution documentation to check how to install tex-live.
